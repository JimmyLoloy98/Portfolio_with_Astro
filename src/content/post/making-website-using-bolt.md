I've been digging into this whole AI thing for front-end development lately, and stumbled upon this cool tools with a incredibles possibilities. Check it out!

Basically, I use [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) to introduce a prompt with specific parameters and I got code made in Next.js. Long story short, you can now use AI to make amazing websites or designs with your requisites. And get this, it only takes some seconds to return the code to you!

Here's the link to the slides from this lightning talk: [My first website without code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11JcjyZfgS-KO2-VyscQrHMabMrZPvL6TecCYfQvuMQU/edit?usp=drive_link)
